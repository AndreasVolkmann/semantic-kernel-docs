# Hackathon Materials for Semantic Kernel

[!INCLUDE [subheader.md](../includes/pat_medium.md)]


# Introduction
We created materials so you can run your own Semantic Kernel Hackathon, a hands-on event where you can learn and create AI solutions using Semantic Kernel tools and resources. 

By participating and running in this hackathon, you will have the opportunity to:

- Explore the features and capabilities of Semantic Kernel and how it can help you solve problems with AI
- Work in teams to brainstorm and develop your own AI skills or apps using Semantic Kernel SDK and services
- Present your results and get feedback from other participants 
- Have fun!


# How to prepare
Before the hackathon, you and your peers will need to download or install some technical prerequisites on your computer. We created a [document]() you can send out.

You will also need to familiarize yourself with the documentation and samples for Semantic Kernel, which will provide you with guidance and examples on how to use its features and functions. You can find them here:

- [Semantic Kernel Documentation](/semantic-kernel/)
- [Semantic Kernel Recipes](/semantic-kernel/howto/recipes)
- [Semantic kernel Receipes Videos] (https://devblogs.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/recipes/)

Additionally, you can check out some sample AI skills that demonstrate how Semantic Kernel can be used for various scenarios or domains. You can use them as inspiration or modify them for your own projects. You can find them here:

- [Semantic Kernel Samples](/semantic-kernel/samples/)


# How to run [NEED TO UPDATE - SAMPLE TABLE BELOW]
The hackathon will consist of four main phases: welcome, overview, development, and presentation. Here is an approximate agenda and structure for each phase but feel free to modify this based on your team:

| Time  | Phase       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 9:00  | Welcome     | The hackathon facilitator will welcome the participants, introduce the goals and rules of the hackathon, and answer any questions. You will also watch a pre-recorded video that will give you an overview of AI and why it is important for solving problems in today's world. You can download the PowerPoint presentation with the video here: [Hackathon Presentation](link) |
| 9:30  | Overview    | The facilitator will guide you through another pre-recorded video that will give you an overview of Semantic Kernel and its features, such as natural language understanding, knowledge graph, and dialog management. You will also see some demos of how Semantic Kernel can be used to create conversational agents for different scenarios or domains.                              |
| 10:00 | Development | The facilitator will help you form teams of 3-5 people based on your interests or skill levels. You will then brainstorm ideas for your own AI skills or apps using design thinking techniques. You will use Semantic Kernel SDKs tools,and resources to develop,test,and deploy your projects.You will have access to Microsoft experts who can assist you with any issues or questions. |
| 12:00 | Presentation   | Each team will present their results using a PowerPoint template provided by Microsoft.You will have about 5 minutes per team to showcase your project,demonstrate how it works,and explain how it solves a problem with AI.You will also receive feedback from other participants.and Microsoft experts.You can download the PowerPoint template here:[Hackathon Template] (link) |

# How to follow up
We hope you enjoyed the Semantic Kernel Hackathon experience! We would love to hear from you about what worked well, what didn't, and what we can improve for future events. Please take a few minutes to fill out this survey and share your feedback and suggestions with us.[Hackathon Survey] (link).

If you want to continue developing your AI skills or projects after the hackathon, you can find more resources and support for Semantic Kernel.
