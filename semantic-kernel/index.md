# What is Semantic Kernel?

![pink circles of semantic kernel](media/skpatternfine.png)

**Semantic Kernel (SK) is a lightweight SDK that lets you easily mix conventional programming languages with the latest in Large Language Model (LLM) AI "prompts" with templating, chaining, and planning capabilities out-of-the-box.**

With SK, you can now build AI-first apps faster by design while also having an insider look at how the SDK has been built. SK has been released as open-source so that more pioneering developers can join in crafting the future of what has emerged as a landmark moment in the history of technology. 

SK was engineered to accelerate Microsoft teams' understandings of the continual evolution of LLM AIs while converting that know-how into the practice of integrating LLM AI into existing apps. With SK, it's much easier to accelerate your innovations' time to market, and to manage for reliability and performance. 

## SK is easy to get LLM AI going on your machine

**[Get started](getting-started/setup) with Semantic Kernel.** Within minutes you can create templated prompts, chained prompts, and reusable skills as pure prompts, native code, or hybrid prompts × code. And soon after, you'll be breaking the barrier to ultra-long prompts with memories and embedding while also integrating i/o from soon-to-be-available connectors.

## SK makes an app developer's life easier

1. **Fast Integration:** SK is designed to be embedded in any kind of application, making it easy for developers to add LLM AI functionality to test inside their apps.

2. **Scalable Magic:** Plain prompts that are fed as API calls only get you so far. SK provides the abstractions and machinery to unlock your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API key.

3. **Novel-But-Familiar:** For 100% determininism, native code is always available as a first-class partner on your prompt engineering quests. You get the best of both worlds.

## SK is for every developer facing new pressures

| 1️⃣ You, or your boss, have noticed that ChatGPT has gotten a lot of attention. | → | 2️⃣ There's a big push to do something similar with LLM AI in your app ... asap. | ↓ |

| → | 3️⃣ You quickly learn that making AI tell a joke is easy. Everything else isn't. | → |  4️⃣ Rather than waste time on LLM AI itself, you want to work on your app instead. |

## SK is under construction for the foreseeable future

Given that new breakthroughs in LLM AIs are landing on a daily basis, you should consider SK a work-in-progress that is the SK team's "best-guess practices" for adding semantically-rich AI to existing apps. And since there are still so many unknown-unknowns in this kind of work, we defer to the community's feedback and contributions to find even better practices going forward, together.
