# What is Semantic Kernel?

![pink circles of semantic kernel](media/skpatternfine.png)

## Semantic Kernel (SK) is a lightweight SDK that lets you easily mix conventional programming languages with the latest in Large Language Model (LLM) AI "prompts" with templating, chaining, and planning capabilities out-of-the-box.

With SK, you can now build AI-first apps faster by design while also having an insider look at how the SDK has been built. SK has been released as open-source so that more pioneering developers can join in crafting the future of what has emerged as a landmark moment in the history of technology. 

SK was engineered to accelerate Microsoft teams' understandings of the continual evolution of LLM AIs while converting that know-how into the practice of integrating LLM AI into existing apps. With SK, it's much easier to accelerate your innovations' time to market, and to manage for reliability and performance. 

## SK is easy to get LLM AI going on your machine

[Get started](getting-started/setup) with Semantic Kernel. Within minutes you can create templated prompts, chained prompts, and reusable skills as pure prompts, native code, or hybrid prompts × code. And soon after you'll be breaking the barrier to ultra long prompts with memories and embedding while also integrating i/o from soon-to-be-available connectors.

## SK makes three things easier for the app developer

1. Fast Integration: The SDK is designed to be embedded in any kind of application, making it easy for developers to add LLM AI functionality to test inside their apps.

2. Magic-At-Scale: Plain prompts that are fed as API calls only get you so far. SK provides the abstractions and machinery to unlock your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API key.

3. Novel But Familiar: For maximum determininism, native code is always availalbe as 


language understanding: Developers bring their own OpenAI or Azure OpenAI key for state-of-the-art language models to understand and interpret natural language input and create skills that enhance their application and make them much more productive.
- Connect to Azure services: The framework allows developers to connect to Azure services allowing their apps to take advantage of Microsoft's powerful capabilities.

## SK is for every developer facing new pressures

| 1️⃣ You, or your boss, have noticed that ChatGPT has gotten really noticed. | 2️⃣ There's a big push to do something similar with LLM AI in your app ... asap. | 3️⃣ You quickly learn that making AI tell a joke is easy. Everything else isn't. | 4️⃣ Rather than waste time on LLM AI itself, you want to work on your app instead. |

## SK is under construction for the foreseeable future

Given that new breakthroughs in LLM AIs are landing on a daily basis, you should consider SK a work-in-progress that is the SK team's "best-guess practices" for adding semantically-rich AI to existing apps. And since there are still so many unknown-unknowns in this kind of work, we defer to the community's feedback and contributions to find even better practices going forward.
