# What is Semantic Kernel?

![pink circles of semantic kernel](media/mainpattern.png)

Semantic Kernel is a lightweight SDK that offers a simple, powerful, and consistent programming model mixing classical code with AI and "semantic" functions, covering multiple programming languages and platforms.

Semantic Kernel  is designed to support and encapsulate several design patterns from the latest in AI research such that developers can infuse their applications with complex skills like prompt chaining, recursive reasoning, summarization, zero/few-shot learning, contextual memory, long-term memory, embeddings, semantic indexing, planning, and accessing external knowledge stores as well as your own data.

# Why use Semantic Kernel to make your apps intelligent?
- Easy integration: The framework is designed to be embedded in any type of application, making it easy for developers to add LLM functionality to their apps with minimal setup and configuration.
- Powerful language understanding: Developers bring their own key for state-of-the-art language models to understand and interpret natural language input and create skills that enhance their application and make them much more productive.
- Connect to Azure services: The framework allows developers to connect to Azure services allowing their apps to take advantage of Microsoft's powerful capabilities.
