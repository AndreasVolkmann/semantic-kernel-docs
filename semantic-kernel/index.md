# What is Semantic Kernel?

Semantic Kernel is a lightweight SDK that offers a simple, powerful, and consistent programming model mixing classical code with AI and "semantic" functions, covering multiple programming languages and platforms.

Semantic Kernel  is designed to support and encapsulate several design patterns from the latest in AI research such that developers can infuse their applications with complex skills like prompt chaining, recursive reasoning, summarization, zero/few-shot learning, contextual memory, long-term memory, embeddings, semantic indexing, planning, and accessing external knowledge stores as well as your own data.
