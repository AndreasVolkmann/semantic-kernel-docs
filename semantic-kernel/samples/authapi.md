# Authentication and API calls sample app
The Authenticated API’s sample allows you to use authentication to connect to the Microsoft Graph using your personal account. If you don’t have a Microsoft account or do not want to connect to it, you can review the code to see the patterns needed to call out to APIs.  The sample highlights how to API’s in your app and the Graph Skills.  Each function will call Microsoft Graph and/or Open AI to perform the tasks you ask about.
