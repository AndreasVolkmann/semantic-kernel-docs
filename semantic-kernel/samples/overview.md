# Overview of sample apps

[!INCLUDE [subheader.md](../includes/pat_medium.md)]

Multiple learning samples are provided in the [Semantic Kernel GitHub repository](/semantic-kernel/getting-started/setup) to help you learn core concepts of Semantic Kernel.

## Samples to get you started

| Sample App | Illustrates |
|---|---|
| [Local API service](localapiservice) | Use the local API service to run the sample apps |
| [Simple chat summary](simplechatsummary) | Use ready-to-use [skills](../concepts-sk/skills) and get those skills into **your** app easily |
| [Book creator](bookcreator) | Use [planner](../concepts-sk/planner) to deconstruct a complex goal and envision using the planner in **your** app |
| [Authentication and APIs](authapi) | Use a basic [connector](/semantic-kernel/concepts-sk/connectors) pattern to authenticate and connect to an API and imagine integrating external data into **your** app's LLM AI |
