# GitHub Repo Q&A bot sample app
The GitHub Repo Q&A Bot sample allows you to pull in data from a public GitHub repo into [Memories](/semantic-kernel/concepts/memories) in order to ask questions about the project and to get answers about it.  The sample highlights how [Memories](/semantic-kernel/concepts/memories) and [Embeddings](/semantic-kernel/concepts/embeddings) work along with functions when the size of the data is larger than the allowed token limited.  Each function will call OpenAI to perform the tasks you ask about.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each function will call OpenAI which will use tokens that you will be billed for.
