# Book creator sample app
The Book creator sample allows you to enter in a topic then the [Planner](/semantic-kernel/concepts/planner) creates a plan for the functions to run based on the ask. You can see the plan along with the results. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each function will call Open AI which will use tokens that you will be billed for.
