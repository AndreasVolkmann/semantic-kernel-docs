# What are Embeddings?

Embeddings are the representations or encodings of tokens, or of larger units of text or code, such as sentences, paragraphs, or documents, in a high-dimensional vector space, where each dimension corresponds to a learned feature or attribute of the language. Embeddings are the way that the model captures and stores the meaning and the relationships of the language, and the way that the model compares and contrasts different tokens or units of language. Embeddings are the bridge between the discrete and the continuous, and between the symbolic and the numeric, aspects of language for the model.
