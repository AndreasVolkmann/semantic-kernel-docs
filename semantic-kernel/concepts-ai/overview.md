# Concepts in LLM AI

[!INCLUDE [pat_large.md](../includes/pat_large.md)]

Large Language Model (LLM) AI is a term that refers to AI models that can generate natural language texts from large amounts of data. Large language models use deep neural networks, such as transformers, to learn from billions or trillions of words, and to produce texts on any topic or domain. Large language models can also perform various natural language tasks, such as classification, summarization, translation, generation, and dialogue. Some examples of large language models are GPT-3, BERT, XLNet, T5, and EleutherAI.

Semantic Kernel builds upon four core ideas in LLM AI:

1. [Models](models)
2. [Prompts](prompts)
3. [Tokens](tokens)
4. [Embeddings](embeddings)
