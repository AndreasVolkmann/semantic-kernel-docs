# Setting up Semantic Kernel

[!INCLUDE [pat_medium.md](../includes/pat_medium.md)]

Getting started with Semantic Kernel (SK) is quick and simple by following these steps:
1. Go to the Semantic Kernel [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel)
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository
3. Jump into the Jupyter notebooks to get going quickly

## Clone the repo locally to set up

Your first step is to clone the repository and move it to your local machine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you have fulfilled the [requirements list](requirements) to run SK on your machine.

1. Go to [aka.ms/semantic-kernel](https://aka.ms/semantic-kernel) to visit the main GitHub page
2. While you're at the SK GitHub page please give it a star to show your support
4. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository to your local machine

## Run the Jupyter notebooks locally

Your second step is to run the Jupyter notebooks locally on your machine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you have fulfilled the [requirements list](requirements) to run SK on your machine.

1. While you have the repository open in VSCode or Visual Studio, go to the jupyter-notebooks section
2. Activate each code snippet with the "play" button on the left hand side
3. Have your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI keys ready to enter when prompted
