# Setting up Semantic Kernel

[!INCLUDE [pat_medium.md](../includes/pat_medium.md)]

Getting started with Semantic Kernel (SK) is quick and simple by following these three steps:

1. Go to the SK [GitHub repository ("repo")](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel)
2. Clone the repo
3. Run the [Jupyter notebooks](../support/troubleshooting#the-jupyter-notebooks-arent-coming-up-in-my-vscode-or-visual-studio) locally

## Step 1: Browse the SK GitHub repo

Use your web browser to visit [aka.ms/sk/repo](aka.ms/sk/repo) and please give it a ⭐️ star to show your support.

## Step 2: Clone the repo to get set up

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you have fulfilled the [requirements list](requirements) to run SK on your machine.

If you are new to using GitHub and have never cloned a repo to your local machine, please review [this guide](https://docs.github.com/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

## Step 3: Run the Jupyter notebooks locally

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you have fulfilled the [requirements list](requirements) to run SK on your machine.

From your local machine:

1. While you have the repository open in VSCode or Visual Studio, go to the jupyter-notebooks section
2. Activate each code snippet with the "play" button on the left hand side
3. Have your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI keys ready to enter when prompted
