# Setting up Semantic Kernel

[!INCLUDE [pat_medium.md](../includes/pat_medium.md)]

Getting started with Semantic Kernel (SK) is quick and simple by following these three steps:

1. Go to the SK GitHub repository ("repo")
2. Clone the repo to your local machine
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks locally

## Step 1: Access the public SK repo

Use your web browser to visit [aka.ms/sk/repo](https://aka.ms/sk/repo) on GitHub and please give the repo a ⭐️ star to show your support.

> Make sure you have fulfilled the [requirements list](/semantic-kernel/getting-started/requirements) to run SK on your machine.

If you are new to using GitHub and have never cloned a repo to your local machine, please review [this guide](https://docs.github.com/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
