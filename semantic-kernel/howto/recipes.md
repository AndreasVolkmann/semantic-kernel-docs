# Get going with the NEW experimental recipe book for quickly learning Semantic Kernel

## How the NEW Open-Source Semantic Kernel is Like a Kitchen for Design Thinking

How would you like to solve gnarly design problems in seconds instead of hours? How about running a full-fledged design thinking workshop in less than a minute? With Large Language Model (LLM) AI, you can start do all that and more. You can also create your own AI skills to enhance your expertise and adapt to the changing needs of design in the era of AI. Learn how to supercharge your problem-solving creativity with Semantic Kernel running on your own machine just like your own “Easy Bake Oven.” We’ll use plenty of cooking analogies to land the core ideas of LLM AI running on Semantic Kernel so be prepared to get hungry!
