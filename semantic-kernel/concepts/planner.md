We call this approach "goal-oriented AI" â€” harking back to the early days of AI when researchers aspired for computers to beat the world's reigning chess champion. That goal was achieved eventually", but instead of being limited to just grand goals, the unusual competence of new LLM AI [models](models) to provide step-by-step directions for practically any task means that everyday goals 

Because the **planner** has access to either a pre-defined library of pre-made **skills* or a dynamically defined set of **skills*, it is able to fulfill an ASK with confidence. 

## What does "goal-oriented" AI mean?

## What if the Planner needs a skill that it doesn't have?

## Next step

Now that you know about the **kernel** and the *planner*, you are ready to learn about **skills**.
