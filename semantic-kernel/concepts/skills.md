# What is a Semantic Kernel function?
A function is a computational machine comprised of Semantic AI and/or native code that's avaialble in a Skill.

## Types of functions
- [Semantic Function](/semantic-kernel/skills/promptfunction): is expressed as a text file “skprompt.txt” using Semantic Kernel’s Prompt Template 
- [Native Function](/semantic-kernel/skills/functiontemplate): is expressed in the conventions of the computing language and easily integrates with Semantic Kernel
