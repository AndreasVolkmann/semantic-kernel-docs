# What are Skills?

A Skill refers to a domain of expertise made avaialble to the kernel as a group of finely tuned computational functions. 

# What is a Semantic Kernel function?
A function is acomputational machine comprised of Semantic AI and/or native code that's avaialble in a Skill.

## Types of functions
- Native Function: is expressed in the conventions of the computing language and easily integrates with Semantic Kernel
- Semantic Function: is expressed as a text file “skprompt.txt” using Semantic Kernel’s Prompt Template
