A **function** is expressed as either:

1. an LLM AI prompt
2. native computer code

Note that when using native computer code, it's also possible to call an LLM AI prompt — which means that hybrid LLM AI × native **functions** can be created. In addition, prompts can be connected end-to-end, or "chained together," to create more powerful capabilities.

## How are skills packaged in code?

With a text file "skprompt.txt" that's using SK's Prompt Template format ...
