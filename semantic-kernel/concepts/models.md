# What are Models?

A model refers to a specific instance or version of an LLM AI, such as GPT-3 or Codex, that has been trained and fine-tuned on a large and diverse corpus of text or code (in the case of the Codex model), and that can be accessed and used through an API or a platform. OpenAI and Azure OpenAI offer a variety of models that can be customized and controlled through parameters or options, and that can be applied and integrated to various domains and tasks.
