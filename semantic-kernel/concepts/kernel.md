# What is the Kernel?

![](../media/kernelsm.png)

The **kernel** in Semantic Kernel (SK) is the orchestrator of a user's ASK. The **kernel** fulfill the user's desired goal using its available [skills](skills), [memories](memories), and [connectors](connectors). Key features of the **kernel** that facilitate faster development include:

* [Skills](skills): Package your most useful prompts as fully reusable [skills](skills)
* Hybrid Development: Mix your AI prompts with conventional native code fluidly
* Orchestration: Manage complicated LLM AI prompts with complete control
* Future Proof: Use multiple LLM AI models and configurations with specificity

The **kernel** is designed to encourage "function composition" which allows developers to combine and interconnect the input and outputs of skills into a single pipeline.

# Why is it called a "kernel"?

> **Kernel**: "The core, center, or essence of an object or system." â€”[Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kernel)

The term "kernel" can have different meanings in different contexts, but in the case of the Semantic Kernel, the **kernel** refers to an instance of the processing engine that processes an ASK all the way through to fulfillment. In code you will see it instantiated as:

```csharp
// Simple instance
ISemanticKernel my_kernel = SemanticKernel.Build();
```
